Inbound Calling Agent with Twilio, Qwen 2.5 Max, Google Cloud STT, and Amazon Polly

This project demonstrates how to build an inbound calling agent using Twilio for call handling, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for transcribing audio, Qwen 2.5 Max for generating responses, and Amazon Polly for converting text responses to speech.
The agent listens for incoming calls, transcribes the callerâ€™s speech, generates a response using the Qwen AI model, and plays the response back to the caller.
